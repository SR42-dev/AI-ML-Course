KNN :

- K's Nearest Neighbours

- pattern recognition algorithm

- when a set of data points on a graph are split between 2 regions 
  and one point (given point) lies on the boundary, it can help 
  decide which category to put it into

- Steps :

	1. choose number of neighbours (K) to the given point
	2. neighbours will be the K closest points to the given
	   point wrt distance
	3. count the number of neighbours falling into each region
	4. assign a data point to the region with most neighbours
	   (can be any if equal)
