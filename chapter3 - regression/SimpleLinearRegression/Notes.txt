Simple linear regression :

- y (dependent variable) = b0 (constant) + b1x1 (coefficient * independent variable)

- Line equation for data point seperation calculated using error terms 

- Distance of data point from line || to y axis = error term for that point
 
- All possible lines are plotted and the one with the least error rate is selected

- Error rate = RMS value of all error terms
