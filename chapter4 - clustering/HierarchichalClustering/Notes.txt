Hierarchical clustering :

- 2 types : agglomerative (bottom-up), decisive (top-down)

- Steps for agglomerative hierarchical clustering :
	
	1. Consider a set of n data points
	2. Each data point is considered a cluster
	3. Calculate inter data point distances and find the required one
	4. Cluster those two data points
	5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all data points merge into a single cluster

- Calculating inter-data point/cluster distances
	
	- Methods :
		
		1. Closest points
		2. Furthest points
		3. Average distances
		4. Distance between centroids

	- Cluster location is considered to be that of it's centroid

- Dendograms 
	
	- X-axis : data points, Y-axis : euclidean distances
	- <look up images>

- To control number of clusters, set a threshold for euclidean distance

- Number of dendrogram lines intersected by a line drawn at threshold euclidean distance gives the number of clusters

- Optimal number of clusters can be obtained by choosing threshold such that the threshold line intersects the largest set of euclidean distances at the center
