K-means algorithm :

- Iterative algorithm to partition dataset into K pre-defined,
  distinct, non-overlapping, sub-groups

- Sorts data into clusters, easier to manage

- Steps :

	1. Choose K
	2. Select K points (to become centroids for the cluster)
	   (not necessarily part of the dataset)
	3. Assign each data point to the closest centroid
	4. Compute the new centroids after assignment
	5. Reassign each data point to the new closest centroid
	   (in case of reassignment, go back to step 4 and repeat)
	6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 till the centroid no longer moves
	7. This is the true centroid for any given cluster

- Random initialization trap :

	- When different initialisations give different clusters
	- Solved by K-means++

- Selecting the right number of clusters

	- WCSS - With in Cluster Sum of Square matrix
	- WCSS = summation((distance between points in cluster 1 and centroid)^2)
		 + summation((distance between points in cluster 2 and centroid)^2)
		 + ...
	- Number of clusters v/s WCSS forms an asymptote
	- Optimal number of clusters -> at the elbow of the curve
